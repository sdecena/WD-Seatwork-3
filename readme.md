## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
The project involves creating a variety of web design components including 5 static header designs, 5 animated header designs, 5 static footer designs, and 5 animated footer designs. The purpose is to showcase our creativity and develop our skills in web design. The key components include various layouts/designs for both header and footer and different animations as well. We used HTML and CSS to create these designs. By using these tools correctly, we ensure that our created designs are visually appealing and organized.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
